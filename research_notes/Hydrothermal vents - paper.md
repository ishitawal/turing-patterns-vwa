Another paper from nature on hydrothermal vents - explains fundamental information such as sepentenisation

- gradients (temp, pressure, redox, concentration) - always in nature
- gradients --> usable energy = key process in biology/industry

- cells: harvest energy from ionic gradients by selective ion transport across membranes (proteins)

- osmotic power generation: energy from ionic g. through intricate nanoscale structures

- ionic gradients --> elctro-chemical energy (Na+, K+, H+, Cl-)
- Layered hydroxide nanocrystals are aligned radially outwards from the HV fluid channels --> nanopores

### Structure of HVs with nanopores
Our findings indicate that ==chemical disequilibria originating from flow and concentration gradients in geologic environments generate confined nanospaces== which enable the spontaneous establishment of osmotic energy conversion.
--> Turing pattern aspect which creates nanostructures

HVs are formed by mineralization chemistry when the hot, reduced ion-rich vent fluid solutions are injected into cooler, oxidizing seawater, and have been discovered as arising from a diverse range of geologic activity.

- first insights of the nanoscale structure and energy conversion functions of ".." HV precipitates:
		Contains interconnected nanopores with variable surface charges, allowing it to convert diverse ionic gradients into electrical energy – a process called osmotic energy harvesting.
		complex internal structure comprised of porous columnar structures

### Alignment of brucite across the macro scale

within the HV precipitates (with wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)): a band-like structure was
observed, due to the periodic density changes of the brucite crystals within the HV wall

### Ion adsorption and surface charge of HV minerals

 The existence of both brucite with carbonate ions and Mg-carbonate crystals indicates that the interconnected HV walls are exposed to various inorganic ions that are present in the hydrothermal fluid and seawater. As brucite is able to adsorb a wide variety of inorganic ions 32,33 , the surface charge of HV precipitates can significantly change depending on the composition of the surrounding fluids


brucite adsorbs K + , Ca 2+ , CO 3 2- , NO 3 - , and SO 4 2- (Fig. 4e).
Furthermore, the zeta potential of the HV samples varied greatly depending on the type of adsorbed ion

### Osmotic energy conversions in HVs

## Discussion

The findings from the present study provide experimental evidence for ==geochemically driven self organization of the inorganic structure and energy conversion function of serpentinite-hosted SSF HV systems==. The periodic banding pattern found in the ==HV samples can be interpreted within the framework of combined chemical (reaction) and physical (diffusion) processes==38–40. Reactions involving transport phenomena such as diffusion or flow intrinsically provide spatially varying concentrations41,42. Especially in systems with internal feedback, such as precipitation accompanied by a pH change, ionic concentrations, show spatial and temporal oscillation, resulting in periodic patterns in the structure43,44. The formation of HVs generated
by the injection of alkaline fluids is a flow-driven formation system that include spatially varying concentration differences. The repetitive banded texture in the HV samples (Figs. 1 and 2) and the periodic formation of areas rich in OH bonds within brucite crystals (Supplementary Fig. 19) provide support for a reaction-diffusion mechanism in HV formation.


Geochemically driven self-organization of inorganic materials provides valuable insights into engineering applications. One such example is selective ion transport membranes, which are a critical component of industrial systems for harvesting energy from salinity gradients between seawater and river water, known as blue energy harvesting.
