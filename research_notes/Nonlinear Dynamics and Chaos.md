### Overview

- Dynamics: deals with change, with systems that evolve in time
	
- Chaos: deterministic system exhibits aperiodic behavior that depends sensitively on the initial conditions, thereby rendering long-term predictions impossible
    
- Partial differential equations: both time t and space x as independent variables
    
- Geometric approach to solve nonlinear systems (p.7):
    
    trajectory - curve with initial conditions and solutions corresponding to a point moving along the curve - equation
    
    phase space - space with coordinates x1,…xn (n-dimensional system)
    
- Framework (p.10):
    
    1.axis - variables needed to characterize the state of the system
    
    2.axis - linear/nonlinear
    
    - partial diff. equa. = infinite “continuum” of variables
