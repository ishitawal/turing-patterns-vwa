1. ∂U∂t=Du∇2U−UV2+F(1−U)
    - ∂U/∂t: The rate of change of the concentration of species U with respect to time.
    - Du∇2U: Diffusion term for species U, representing how U spreads through space. Du is the diffusion rate, and ∇2U is the Laplacian of U, describing the spatial distribution.
    - −UV2: Reaction term for the interaction between U and V. This term indicates that U is being consumed in a reaction proportional to the product of U and V.
    - F(1−U): Feed term for U, representing the input of U into the system. F is the feed rate, and (1−U) represents the available space for U to grow.
2. ∂V∂t=Dv∇2V+UV2−(F+k)V
    - ∂V∂t: The rate of change of the concentration of species V with respect to time.
    - Dv∇2V: Diffusion term for species V, similar to the Du∇2U term in the U equation.
    - UV2: Reaction term for the production of V through the interaction of U and V.
    - −(F+k)V: Removal term for V, representing the combined effects of the feed rate (F) and kill rate (k) reducing the concentration of V.

The equations describe the dynamics of two interacting chemical species (U and V) in a spatial environment. The terms account for diffusion, reaction, feed, and kill processes, which collectively give rise to various spatial patterns and behaviors observed in reaction-diffusion systems. Adjusting the parameters allows researchers to explore different patterns and phenomena within the model.
